- **Stabilize**: Ensure that the tools are reliable and robust for real-world applications.

## Features

### GraphRAG

Proposed by Microsoft, GraphRAG integrates graph-based approaches into RAG, offering several key advantages:

- **Enhanced Data Relationships**: By leveraging graph structures, GraphRAG can better capture and utilize the relationships between different data points, leading to more accurate and insightful results.
- **Scalability**: GraphRAG is designed to handle large-scale data efficiently, making it suitable for applications with extensive datasets.
- **Flexibility**: The graph-based approach allows for more flexible data modeling, accommodating complex and dynamic data structures.
- **Improved Query Performance**: GraphRAG can optimize query performance by efficiently navigating through the graph, reducing the time required to retrieve relevant information.

### HybridRAG

Proposed by Intel, HybridRAG combines different RAG methodologies to enhance performance and flexibility. Its advantages include:

- **Versatility**: HybridRAG integrates multiple RAG techniques, allowing it to adapt to various types of data and use cases.
- **Performance Optimization**: By combining the strengths of different RAG methods, HybridRAG can achieve higher performance and accuracy in data retrieval and analysis.
- **Robustness**: The hybrid approach ensures that the system remains robust and reliable, even when dealing with diverse and complex datasets.
- **Customizability**: Users can customize HybridRAG to fit specific requirements, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.
